/* Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

Your function would return the following array:

["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.*/


function sortByLength (array) {
    return array.sort((a, b) => a.length - b.length) 
  };

/* find multiples of a number 
In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit . If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6), the function should return [2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.

If you can, try writing it in only one line of code.*/

  function findMultiples(integer, limit) {
    let multiples = []
    for (let i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {
      if ((i * integer) <= limit) {
      multiples.push(i*integer)
      }
    } return multiples
  }
